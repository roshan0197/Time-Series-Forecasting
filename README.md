# Predictive Data Modelling and Analysis

The data is from the M4 Forecasting competition and spanned over almost 10 years. Analysis was done for Series 3, Series 31, and Series 59. 

Time series, consisting of systematic and irregular components, is deconstructed  by calculating Centered Moving Averages and plotting seasonal plots, whilst conducting decomposition plots through R functions.

The time series proceeded to statistical analysis wherein Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) and augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test (ADF) statistical tests were conducted to associate trends with the data.
 
To train forecasting models, we require the data to be non-stationary i.e no trend nor seasonality.


 KPSS	Test 
 
 Null hypothesis H0 -  Stationary 

 Alternative hypothesis H1 - Non-stationary

 
 ADF	Test   
 
 Null hypothesis H0 - Non-stationary	      
 Alternative hypothesis H1 - Stationary
